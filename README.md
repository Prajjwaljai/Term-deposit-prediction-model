Final Project ‚Äì Data Science Course (Internshala)
# Term-deposit-prediction-model

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic data and telemarketing call details. The goal is to assist a retail bank in identifying potential customers most likely to convert, helping reduce telemarketing costs and improve campaign efficiency.

## üß© Problem Statement

A retail banking client wants to optimize their **telephonic marketing campaigns** used to sell **term deposits**‚Äîa key revenue source.

> Telephonic campaigns are costly and time-consuming. The bank wants to **predict in advance** which clients are likely to subscribe to the term deposit so it can **target only those clients**, saving resources.
